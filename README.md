# Modular AI Assistant Architecture (MAIA)

A clean, modular design for building efficient AI assistants using LLMs, memory layers, routing, and micro-modules.

## 🔍 Overview

LLMs are great—but they're expensive, stateless, and overloaded with tasks they shouldn't be handling. This architecture breaks the assistant into intelligent layers that work together to reduce compute waste, increase performance, and support long-term context.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- Task routing based on intent
- Memory-aware responses using vector storage
- Semantic caching and TTL
- Small logic handlers for things like math, time, and lookups
- LLMs reserved for complex, creative, or multi-step tasks
- Security and abuse protection layer

## 🚧 Status

This is a concept architecture. Not implemented yet. Feedback welcome.
