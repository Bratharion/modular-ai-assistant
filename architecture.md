# Modular AI Assistant Architecture (MAIA)

**Author:** Brandi

**Overview:**
This document outlines a practical and efficient architecture for building modular AI assistants that reduce computational load, improve performance, and maintain the general intelligence and flexibility of large language models (LLMs). This system is designed for scalability, robustness, and future extensibility.

## 1. Problem Statement

Current LLM-based assistants are:
- **Stateless:** Require full context on each query.
- **Monolithic:** Every taskâ€”trivial or complexâ€”is handled by the LLM.
- **Inefficient:** Wastes compute on simple tasks.
- **Vulnerable:** Susceptible to abuse or DDoS-style overload.

These limitations create high operational costs, slow response times, and limited personalization.

## 2. System Design Overview

**Goal:** Design a modular, layered architecture that intelligently routes tasks to the right subsystem, preserves long-term context, and optimizes LLM usage.

### Key Layers:
- **Router Layer:** Determines task type and routes appropriately.
- **Memory Layer:** Stores and retrieves user preferences, history, and context.
- **Cache Layer:** Delivers quick answers for known questions.
- **Micro-Handlers:** Small tools handle math, logic, search, and more.
- **LLM Layer:** Reserved for complex, creative, or multi-step reasoning.
- **Security Layer:** Protects against abuse and ensures stable throughput.

## 3. Component Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Router Layer
- Built with Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- Parses inputs and assigns them to:
  - Micro-handler (e.g. math)
  - Vector database (memory)
  - LLM (OpenAI, Claude, local)
  - Cache (if response previously seen)
- Includes fallback to LLM on uncertainty.

### ðŸ”¹ Memory / Context Layer
- Vector database (e.g., Chroma, FAISS)
- Stores context as embeddings
- Injects only relevant memory into LLM prompts
- Allows tagging, pinning, and temporal biasing

### ðŸ”¹ Cache Layer
- Stores common Q&A pairs (Redis, SQLite)
- Uses input fingerprinting + TTL expiration
- Cache-aware fallbacks to LLM when outdated

### ðŸ”¹ Micro-Handlers
- Lightweight Python modules or APIs
- Example modules:
  - Date/time calculator
  - Unit conversions
  - DNS lookups
  - FAQ database access

### ðŸ”¹ LLM Integration
- Accesses OpenAI, Claude, or Ollama (local)
- Handles reasoning, logic, creative generation
- Final output composer if multiple sources contribute

### ðŸ”¹ Security & Abuse Protection
- Rate limiting
- Bot detection
- Throttling under high load
- Safe user override for routing

## 4. Risk Mitigation

| Risk                        | Mitigation Strategy                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Misrouted Input             | Confidence scoring, fallback to LLM                      |
| Overaggressive Caching      | TTL, user overrides, fingerprinting                      |
| Incomplete Context Injection| Tagging, recency bias, manual memory pinning             |
| Fragmented Output           | Route all modules through LLM as a response composer     |
| Coordination Overhead       | Selective parallelization, profiling, route efficiency   |
